### Thinkful Challenge: Text Analyzer
---
> In this challenge, I built a small web app that runs basic text analytics on user submitted text. Displays the following 4 metrics:

- Total word count of the submitted text
- Unique word count of the submitted text
- Average word length in characters of the submitted text
- Count of Sentences in any given paragraph of the submitted text

The program should print each of these metrics in the appropriate area in the results section.
