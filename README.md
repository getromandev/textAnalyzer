# Thinkful Challenge: Text Analyzer

In this challenge, you'll implement a small web app that runs basic text analytics on user submitted text. We provide initial HTML and CSS files, and you'll be responsible for adding CSS classes to the HTML for your JavaScript code to hook into, and for writing JavaScript code that computes and displays 4 metrics:

- Total word count of the submitted text
- Unique word count of the submitted text
- Average word length in characters of the submitted text
- Average sentence length in characters of the submitted text.

The program should print each of these metrics in the appropriate area in the results section.
